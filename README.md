# PMT (Package Manager Translator)

PMT is a lightweight command-line tool designed to facilitate the translation of package names between different package managers on Linux distributions, such as apt or dnf. Whether you're migrating projects or managing dependencies across different Linux distributions, PMT aims to simplify the process.

## Features

- **Package Manager Compatibility**: Translate package names between different package managers on Linux distributions seamlessly.
- **Simple Command-Line Interface**: Just install as you would with any distribution.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight and efficient, PMT aims to keep dependencies to a minimum.
